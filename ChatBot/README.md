# 🌍 TravelGPT – Travel Chatbot using Python + Groq API

TravelGPT is a command-line AI chatbot built in Python and powered by Meta's LLaMA3-70B model via Groq’s OpenAI-compatible API. It responds exclusively to travel-related queries and politely redirects off-topic ones using prompt-based personality tuning.

Developed during my internship at GET Tutorials under the GET AnalyticX initiative, this project helped me learn how to design domain-specific assistants, integrate LLMs, and structure interactive command-line flows using the OpenAI SDK.

✨ Features:
• Travel-specific chatbot behavior
• Real-time terminal interface
• Smart response handling using LLaMA3-70B via Groq
• Prompt engineering for topic filtering
• Clean, modular CLI logic

📦 Setup & Run:
1. Navigate to this ChatBot folder
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install openai
3. (Optional) Store your API key in a .env file
4. Run the bot:
   python Travel_Assistant.py
5. To exit:
   Type exit or quit

🛠️ Technologies Used:
• Python – for scripting
• Groq API – hosts LLaMA3-70B model
• OpenAI SDK – integrates Groq endpoint
